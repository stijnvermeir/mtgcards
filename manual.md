MTGCards is a tool to manage your collection and decks of Magic the Gathering cards.

First run
---------

When you run MTGCards for the first time, it will look bad. That's normal.
You'll have to configure some stuff before you can work with it properly.

### 1. Card pool database
MTGCards does not embed the MTG card data into its binaries,
but requires the [AllSets.json file](http://mtgjson.com/json/AllSets.json.zip) from <http://mtgjson.com>.

This means that every time WotC releases a new MTG set, you don't need to update the application! Yay!
Just replace your AllSets.json file with the latest version.

1. Download the latest version from the file and put it somewhere on your computer.
2. In Options, tab Data Sources, let MTGCards know where this file is located on your computer.

### 2. Card preview images
MTGCards also does not include images of all the cards. You'll have to find them yourself somewhere ...

Once you find them, you should organize them in a specific way (described below)
and let MTGCards know in which folder they are located.
You can do that in the Data Sources tab in the Options.

#### Card Image Folder Structure and naming convention
You should have a folder per Set. The name of a Set folder should be the same as the value in the *Set Name* column for a card.

Inside a Set folder, you need a .jpg file for each card. The name of this file should be the same as the value in the *Name* column for a card, appended with the .jpg extension.

Any special character in the name of a Set or a card should be replaced by correspending ASCII characters.
In addition there are some more special cases for naming card image files.

##### Example
Let's say you are looking at *Lim-DÃ»l the Necromancer* from the *Time Spiral* Set in the Card Pool window. You don't see a preview image.

1. Create a folder name *Time Spiral* inside your image folder.
2. Copy the image of the card inside this folder and rename the file to *Lim-Dul the Necromancer.jpg*.

##### Split and flip cards
Split and flip cards have more than one name. Concatenate the names with underscores between them.
For example *Give/Take* would become *Give_Take.jpg*.

##### Tokens
Images for tokens should be inside a folder named *token* inside the Set folder. The image should be the token name.

##### Cards with multiple versions (like Basic Lands)
The filenames of such cards should have an extra version tag. This is a number between square brackets.

For example, one version of a Forest inside a Set should have the name *Forest [1].jpg*. Another one should be *Forest [2].jpg*. And so on.

### 3. Window position, size and visibility
The windows will have a default position and size when running for the first time. Adjust their position and size to your liking. Their state will be saved at exit.

### 4. Column width, order and visibility
The columns will have default sizes and will all be visible on the first run. Resize and move them to your liking. You can hide or unhide columns by right-clicking on the header. Their state will be saved at exit.

Features
--------

### Automatic use count tracking of cards in collection
In the Collection window you will see the *Used* column. This value is calculated from *active* decks that use this card.

A deck can be activated or deactivated by toggling the switch in the Deck window.

When you hover over a *Used* cell, you can see how many time the card is used in which deck. You can right click on the row and select *Open decks where this card is used* to open them.

For this feature to work properly, the .deck files should be kept in the *decks* folder inside the MTGCards Application Folder. Where this folder is located, can be found in the Options under Misc. It can also be changed there.

### Advanced Filter
You can set a filter per window (Pool, Collection and Deck). You can create an entire filter tree and group filters in **AND** and **OR** groups. There are different filter types:

1. **Regex** Regular expression support (very powerful)
2. **Number** Compare numeric fields against a number
3. **Date** Compare date fields against a date
4. **Time** Compare timestamp fields against a time

### Proxy generation
In the Deck window, you can select multiple cards. When you click *Create Proxies*, choose a name for the output PDF. The selected cards will be printed and cards will be printed as many times as they are used in the deck.

### Keyboard search
After selecting a cell in Pool, Collection or Card window, you can just start typing and the application will search for the first matching cell in that column.

Select a different cell to reset the keyboard search.

Start your search with ^ and it will only match if the name starts with the search string.

Use PgUp and PgDn to go the previous or next match.

### Customization
MTGCards aims to be very customizable.

#### Multi display support
Every element of the application has its own window. This way it's a piece of cake to put your Deck window on one screen and the Pool window on another.

#### Keyboard shortcuts
You can change the default keyboard shortcuts in the Options under *Shortcuts*.

#### User columns
You can define your own columns in the Options under *User Columns*. After a restart of the application, your columns will become available in the Collection and Deck window. You can also use them in filters.

### Import collection and decks

#### Import collection
You can import your collection from a .csv file in UTF-8 encoding. The expected format is: 3-letter set code;name;quantity.

For example:

	M12;Acidic Slime;4
	ISD;Mikaeus, The Lunarch;1

Only the official 3-letter codes are recognized. You will have to manually fix them if your current collection uses different codes.

Special characters in card names should not be replaced.

#### Import deck
You can import multiple decks from UTF-8 encoded XML files. MTGCards will look for *card* elements.

XML attributes:

* **edition** Official 3-letter set code
* **deck** The quantity of that card in the deck
* **sb** The amount that card is on the Sideboard

XML card element content should be the card name.

For example:

	<card edition="M12" deck="1" sb="0">Acidic Slime</card>
	<card edition="ISD" deck="0" sb="1">Mikaeus, The Lunarch</card>
	
### Multi-platform
MTGCards is a native desktop application available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.
